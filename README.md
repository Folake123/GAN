# GAN
The unbalanced nature of network datasets is a major challenge with applying machine
learning algorithms to identify malicious activities on the network. It is difficult to train
the classifier due to the underrepresented attack data and severe class distribution skews.
There is need to generate more representation of the attack data in order to train the model
for effective and efficient classification. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a
newer class of neural networks, which learn from the given data and use that information
to generate something similar. This project used GANs to balance the skewed UGRâ€™16
dataset.
